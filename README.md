# FitJoe
FitJoe is a workout plan creator that I built to assist my bi-weekly schedule of exercise. The idea of this came from when I was using an app for free to do this, but it then wanted to charge me Â£79/year for the service. Instead of paying I thought it would be a good project idea to build an app that did the same thing for me, and would be totally free. That's when I started to program FitJoe. This was a process of a few simple parts:
  1) Create a python dictionary of exercises with the keys being the area of the body that was being exercised and the value pairs, a list of different exercises for that area of the body. This meant manually researching and typing all of the different exercises that there are that I can complete.
  2) Then creating a function that selected at random a different exercise from each key and displayed the results into a list.
  3) Exporting this file to a csv document that produced a simple table of exercises, and the area of the body being exercised.
  4) Creating a ezgmail command that sent the file to my email address, so that I could open the file on my phone, ready for use when I workout.
  5) Putting the finishing touches on it such as giving the app an icon for my desktop and testing it.

Overall, the project took me just over a day, and although the program is not as sophistacted as the app I was using (e.g. Recovery times and syncing with other health apps), it does the job that I wanted it to and has saved me from signing up to a pricey subscription!
